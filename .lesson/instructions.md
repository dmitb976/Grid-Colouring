**Only begin this task if you have already finished Exercise 3.**

## Instructions

Go to **script.js** under **Files** and complete the bodies of `setup()` and `draw()` to replicate the image below. Use a *loop* to draw the lines.

*Do not* modify anything in **index.html**. This HTML file needs to be there in order for the sketch to display properly.

When it works, click **Submit** in the top right corner. 

## Challenge

If you'd like a challenge, you can modify the program so that it chooses a new random square each time (i.e. it doesn't recolour a square that's already coloured) and when all the squares are coloured they turn back to white and get recoloured one by one again.

## script.js

Here is the original code in **script.js** for reference:

```javascript
function setup() {
	createCanvas(500, 500);
  frameRate(15);
  // What else goes here?
}

function draw() {
  // What goes here?
}
```
